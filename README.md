# Brand-Safety-Placement-Impression-Mapping
This Python script compares impressions from multiple DV360 CSV reports with a summary Excel file (Parul’s report). It extracts Date, Advertiser, and Impressions, normalizes advertiser names, merges both datasets, and generates an output with DV360 impressions, Parul impressions, Delta, and Delta%.
